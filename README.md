# Anomaly-detection-fraudulent-listings
Flagging suspicious secondhand fashion seller listings

# Files:
**anomaly_detection_for_fraudulent_listings.ipynb**: jupyter notebook with project code <br /><br />
**seller listings.csv**: list of product listings posted by sellers on a secondhand fashion app. The file contains the seller's overall return rate for products they have sold in the past on a scale of 0-1, the seller's overall app rating on a scale of 0-1, number of units sold and returned on the app, the brand of the product listed, product type of product listed, and the listing price for the product listed. <br /><br />
**brand, product retail prices.csv**: list of retail prices for brand/product type combinations (i.e. brand= gucci;  product type= shoes). This will be used to define the average 
retail selling price for the anomaly detection to determine if the seller's listing is significantly different.
